# Waaazap
A hackathon project


## This branch (Python + Flask + WebSocket + Redis)

This branch is an experimental branch for a potential cloud 
solution. It runs on Heroku with Python + Flask, and will 
serve the Jinja2 template content.

It will also try to serve some real-time graphs based on the 
data, which we will receive from our backend cloud webservice.


## Technology stack

*Device:* A voting device with 4x buttons

*Cloud:* A endpoint which receives input signals from the _device_

*Client:* The web client (_Angular_) which will present the votes in a neatly manner
